              From the moment your pregnancy is confirmed, you'll probably have a whirlwind of emotions and questions. I will be there for you to process things, answer your questions and make recommendations for services in the area.  We will have 2 prenatal visits together to go over your birth preferences and set up a postpartum plan. These can be alone or with your partner included. I am always available over the phone: either through calls, texts or video calls. You'll have access to my lending library of books and to my brain of knowledge.

          <div className='service-description'>
            Beginning at 38 weeks I will be “on-call” 24/7 for you until you give birth to your new bundle of joy. I will be more than happy to meet you at your home to assist in laboring as long as you can there, then transferring to your birthing place with you if need be. I will be there to remind your partner of comforting measures to help you with and also to step in to give them rest if they need it. Support is different for every laboring woman, so whether you need an extra hand to hold, extra counter pressure, encouraging words, or for someone to be the one to just make sure you are drinking your water, I will do whatever you need and I believe being in being flexible to your needs. You'll have me by your side every step of the way.

          <div className='service-description'>
            Some people forget this part of pregnancy and birth, which can be a real problem. I believe that you and your new family needs the support during the postpartum period just as much as during labor. I will stay with you post delivery to get things cleaned and make sure you're settled. Once I leave, you'll still have access to me until 6 weeks post delivery. This is the time for any questions, just to talk, or needs of recommendations. I will also schedule with you a postpartum visit about a week to two weeks after your baby is born just to go over how you feel your birth went and to see if you all are adjusting well. If you need further postpartum doula care, I'd be happy to refer you to a wonderful gal in the area.
