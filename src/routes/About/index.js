            It's so nice to meet you! I'm Sadie. I'm married to this hunk, Daniel and we have a beautiful daughter named Adelina and another baby girl on the way! I am obsessed with all things related to birthâ€¦placentas, vernix, contractions, you name it. If that's your jam too, we can totally talk more about it during our visits
          </p>
          <p>A few fun facts about me not related to birth:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>I have an obsession with Bob's Burgers. I had it on in the background of my own labor with my first daughter. </li>
            <li>I have a Bachelor's of Arts degree in History and Art History from the University of South Carolina </li>
            <li>I have a dream of owning a homestead one day, complete with a dairy cow, chickens, and lots of land for my babies to grow up on</li>
